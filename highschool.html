          Off the court Carter kept a B-average in his classes, realizing the
          correlation between good grades and a professional career.
          "I wasn't the greatest student, but I sure wasn't the worst, either,"
          Carter recalls to Doug Smith in “The Vince Carter Story.” "I knew I
          had to keep my grades up if I wanted to play basketball. If there was
          one thing my mom and dad stressed all the time, it was the need to
          study and keep the grades up so I could play ball."
          Heading into his junior season, Carter’s coach moved him from guard
          to forward after a growth-spurt helped him stretch to six-foot-six.
          That year, the high-flier averaged 25 points and 11 rebounds while
          leading the Buccaneers to a 30-2 record.
          Winning his second “Florida’s Mr. Basketball” award in two years,
          Carter started to build a recruitment case his senior year. While
          writing halftime band music and maintaining a 3.0 GPA, Carter helped
          earn national attention for his team.
