          In the summer of 2001, Carter signed a $94 million, six-year extension
          with the Raptors.In addition, Carter announced that he would be
          hosting a charity basketball game featuring fellow NBA stars that would
          be played at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto on August 3, 2001. The
          success of the first game being sold out encouraged Carter to make the
          charity game an annual summer event.The next season was an injury-riddled
          one for Carter. He started in 60 games and he averaged 24.7 ppg. He
          was voted into the 2002 NBA All-Star Game, but he could not participate
          due to injury. The Raptors did not fare well without their All-Star
          player. The team lost 17 of 18 games to drop to 30–38, then won 12 of
          their last 14 to finish at 42–40. On December 12, 2001, in a win against
          the Denver Nuggets, Carter recorded 42 points, 15 rebounds, 6 assists
          and 5 steals to become only the second player in NBA history to record
          at least 40 points, 15 rebounds, 5 assists and 5 steals since the NBA
          started recording steals.Carter was injured during the 2002
          NBA Playoffs, and his team was defeated in the first round by the Detroit
          Pistons, in five games. During the 2003 NBA All-Star Game, Carter gave
          up his starting All-Star spot to the Washington Wizards' Michael Jordan
          to allow Jordan to make his final start as an All-Star.During his
          Raptors tenure, news came out that Carter had developed Sinding-Larsen-Johansson
          disease also known as "jumper's knee", which drew criticism and questions
          from local media outlets and fans about Carter's long term durability
          as a NBA scorer.
          Fifty games into the 2003–04 season, Toronto was 25–25 and in a position
          to make the playoffs, but injuries to Jalen Rose, Alvin Williams, and
          Carter sent the Raptors plummeting down the standings, and the Raptors
          fell three games short of making the playoffs. Carter's individual season
          performance was 22.5 ppg, with teammate Alvin Williams's knee injury
          turning out to be career ending.
